# üè® Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes patterns and factors contributing to hotel booking cancellations. Using machine learning models, specifically XGBoost, I predicted cancellations with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for hotel revenue management.

## Project Goals
- Identify key features influencing booking cancellations.
- Develop and evaluate predictive models (XGBoost classifier).
- Provide actionable insights through clear visualizations.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle dataset "[Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)".
- **Features:** Guest demographics, booking history, cancellation status, reservation details, etc.

## Methods & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost, scikit-learn
- **Techniques:** Data exploration, feature engineering, predictive modeling, evaluation (ROC Curve, confusion matrix).

## Key Visualizations
- Correlation Heatmap
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- XGBoost Feature Importance

## Results
Achieved high predictive accuracy (approximately 85%), clearly highlighting features such as lead time, deposit type, and previous cancellations as most significant predictors.
