# Project Overview
The Beach Attendance Analysis Project examined environmental and social factors influencing public beach attendance. Leveraging historical data, predictive models were developed to forecast attendance patterns, helping stakeholders better allocate resources and plan events.

## Project Goals

Identify key factors driving beach attendance (e.g., weather, day of the week, holidays).

Forecast daily beach attendance to optimize resource management.

Communicate findings clearly through visualizations and interactive dashboards.

## Methods & Tools

Data Collection: Public records, weather APIs

Analysis Techniques: Regression modeling, time series forecasting

Visualization: Tableau dashboards, Python plots (matplotlib)

## Insights & Results

Developed an accurate predictive model (85% accuracy).

Clearly communicated actionable insights on peak attendance factors to city planners and local businesses.
