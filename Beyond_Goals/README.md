# Project Overview
The "Beyond Goals" project explores advanced soccer metrics to identify which statistics most effectively predict team success and player performance. Using datasets from leading soccer analytics providers, I conducted detailed statistical analyses and visualizations to highlight insights beyond basic goal-scoring data.

## Project Goals

Identify soccer metrics with strong predictive power.

Improve understanding of performance factors beyond traditional goal-scoring metrics.

Provide actionable insights for coaches, analysts, and scouts.

## Methods & Tools

Data Preparation: Python (pandas, NumPy)

Statistical Analysis: Correlation, regression modeling

Visualization: Tableau, matplotlib, seaborn

## Key Findings

Metrics such as expected goals (xG), progressive passes, and shot-creating actions were identified as highly predictive.

Visualization dashboards clearly highlighted player efficiency and team effectiveness.
